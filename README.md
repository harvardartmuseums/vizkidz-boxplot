# VizKidz Box Plot

This project is a fully functioning prototype of a Bertie-Boxplot-inspired museum exhibit proposed by Liv Buli of Viz Kidz. Visitors can enter their age and see their input reflected in a dynamic box plot.

To view this project, open http://vizkidz-boxplot.herokuapp.com/boxplot.html on at least one screen and direct visitors to open http://vizkidz-boxplot.herokuapp.com/input.html on their own devices. 

Note: while the box plot can be displayed on more than one screen at once, it must be kept running on at least one screen to ensure data is retained.
